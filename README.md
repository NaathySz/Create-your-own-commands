Its simple, but useful plugin. For beginners or not, it will save time.   
A different (and better?) version of [this](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=338672)
***

### Infos
Put your commands in .cfg file and split with _|_.
At the left is the command, and right what will print in chat. You can use colors too.

Example: `test|{darkred}[TAG] {blue}This is a test`   
You dont need put `!` at start. The trigger will active automatically and not work without.
More examples in cfg file.
